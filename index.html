    The internet is a global network that allows computers to communicate by exchanging data as bits (1s and 0s) through physical connections like cables. To solve the problem of scale, switches are used to create Local Area Networks (LANs), where multiple devices connect efficiently. For connecting different LANs across locations, routers are introduced, forming a ‚Äúnetwork of networks,‚Äù which is the foundation of the internet. Every device requires a unique identifier called an IP address so routers can forward data to the correct destination. Large data is broken into smaller packets, each carrying source and destination addresses, and reassembled reliably using TCP/IP protocols. Supporting concepts include IPv4 (limited addresses), IPv6 (virtually unlimited addresses), public vs private IPs, MAC addresses (hardware identifiers), and ports (service identifiers like HTTP=80). The Domain Name System (DNS) translates domain names into IP addresses, enabling user-friendly browsing. Together, these systems ensure reliable, scalable, and efficient communication worldwide.

        HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and structure web pages. 
        It works with tags that give meaning to text and enable linking between webpages. 
        Headings (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>‚Äì<code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>) provide structure and importance, 
        while paragraphs (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>) group sentences into meaningful blocks of content. 
        The <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> tag creates a horizontal rule to separate sections, 
        and <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> adds line breaks within text. 
        Lists are organized with <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> for unordered (bulleted) lists, 
        <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> for ordered (numbered) lists, and <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> for items, 
        which can also be nested. 
        The anchor tag (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>) makes hypertext possible, allowing links to external sites, 
        internal files, or sections within a page. 
        The <code>target</code> attribute controls how links open (same tab, new tab, etc.). 
        Finally, the image tag (<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>) embeds visuals, requiring <code>src</code> 
        for the image path and <code>alt</code> text for accessibility. 
        Together, these elements form the foundation of creating structured, connected, 
        and interactive web pages.

    <h3>lecture 3</h3>
    <p>
Lecture 3 focused on the concept of file paths and the importance of boilerplate code in HTML. A website is a collection of interconnected files, and the browser needs file paths to locate resources like images, CSS, and JavaScript. Two types of file paths were discussed: relative and absolute. Relative paths, the most common, define the location of a file in relation to the current file, such as accessing files in the same folder, sub-folders, or parent folders using ‚Äú../‚Äù. Absolute paths provide the full web address, beginning with ‚Äúhttp‚Äù or ‚Äúhttps‚Äù, and are mainly used for external resources. The lecture also introduced HTML boilerplate code, which ensures proper structure, encoding (UTF-8), and compatibility across browsers. Key HTML elements like div, span, class, and id were explained for structuring and styling content. Finally, the importance of consistent layouts using header, main, and footer for multi-page websites was highlighted.

Forms in HTML allow websites to collect and send user information to servers, enabling essential features like login, search, comments, and purchases. The core element is the &lt;form&gt;, which contains fields and a submit button. The &lt;input&gt; element is used for various inputs, with labels (&lt;label&gt;) linked using id and for attributes to improve usability and accessibility. The name attribute identifies data for the server. Radio buttons (&lt;input type="radio"&gt;) let users select one option, while checkboxes (&lt;input type="checkbox"&gt;) allow multiple choices. Textareas (&lt;textarea&gt;) handle longer text, and dropdowns (&lt;select&gt; with &lt;option&gt;) manage many options compactly. The &lt;button&gt; element offers flexible submission styling. HTML5 introduced specialized inputs like password, number (with min/max), date, color, range, and file upload, making forms more user-friendly and secure. With these features, forms become a powerful two-way interaction tool between users and web applications.

HTML5 introduced native support for embedding audio and video directly into webpages without relying on insecure third-party plugins like Flash or QuickTime. The core elements are the &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; tags, which make media integration simple and standardized across modern browsers. By default, a &lt;video&gt; tag with only a source shows a static frame, so the <i>controls</i> attribute is essential to provide play, pause, volume, and fullscreen options. Additional attributes like width, height, autoplay, muted, loop, and poster allow customization and better user experience. The &lt;audio&gt; tag works similarly, enabling podcasts, music, and sound effects with controls. To handle browser compatibility, developers use the &lt;source&gt; element to provide multiple file formats such as MP4, WebM, or OGG, ensuring videos play across devices. Accessibility is addressed with the &lt;track&gt; element, allowing captions, subtitles, and translations in .vtt format for users with hearing or language barriers. Two approaches exist: the professional &lt;source&gt; method for maximum compatibility and fallback, and the simpler src method for quick embedding, though less reliable. Additionally, HTML entities like &amp;copy;, &amp;reg;, &amp;trade;, and &amp;euro; allow easy inclusion of symbols in webpages. Overall, HTML5 media elements revolutionized the web by making multimedia integration seamless, accessible, and universal.
